notes
Still need discipline.
Take "good" result and turn
into a project.

Use different methods or classifiers
how do you decide which algorithm to use.

Need to train, validation, and test

Train all methods on same training data.

contamination, cross talk between the data
sets is very easy to mess it up. The temptation to
cheat.

Huge dataset for training image data.

Team from microsoft submitted different algorithms
several times a day.
They were essentially just sampling
the space of classifiers
to get better results. 

do employ gridsearch to compare methods

LinearRegression, elastic net.
make the next variable continuous instead of binary

Can still use logistic regression but this would predict
intervals.

Hard to find causality without knowing something on the data.

explain motivation
explain code
explain result.
