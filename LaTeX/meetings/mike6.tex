\subsubsection{project proposal...backtracking}

Couldn't find a good sized data set that didn't require
credentials of some sort.
Found the CDC's BRFSS data; phone survey with
lots of people;

405 columns, 432607 entries rows for 2009.
Wanted to see if I could find something that
correlates with the H1N1 flu trend.

The way that data is generated
is unreliable. The technical point
of view

The question I should always hear is
from the job interview is

Look at the number of cases at CDC.
Google tried to predict the flu
but had to give up.

Look at some years.

Average reporting, news, reactions etc.

It's ok to restart, update the proposal
with a new data set.
Don't want work to be wasted. Can
improve things before job interview.

Combination of both narrative and dataset;
just need to find somewhere in between.
I know the ``steps'' but they don't have an idea of
how it's going to end.

"what do you want to do with the results"
we were hoping you would tell us that.

Don't spend too much time.
Economics sunk cost; what's going
Trying to emphasize that the proposal is
good but does not have to.

Very encouraging Mike, right idea wrong data
set.

Remember undergraduate asshole business student.
