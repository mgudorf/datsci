notebook versus google doc;

no reply yet. If the only thing that they see is
google docs

using google doc as a summary;

the best advertisement is the best communication
and ideas are best explained via figures.

Google doc is for the non-technical audience


Put yourself in the position of how I would implement this;

What do I have to tell a person so that a monkey can do it?

When it comes to prediction and get it here and put it here and
label it like this.

Comment about past aggregation.

When it comes to one-hot-encoding, include three extra columns
missing, other, and new. new wont have any samples but its ok.


have the dates; for each date, have several loans or no loans.

non-uniform dataset

staggered window for time-series split.

remove variables. 

Have to create own time series cross validation sets.

For loan classification: drop all variables that occur after the issuance date.
Bin categorical variables with too many categories. Be smart with the binning.
do nothing to numerical data except rescaling.

for recovery prediction; everything is occurring at a snapshot in time, so can
use all of the data, just subset based off on charged off loans or not. 

Cross validation selects the model. Once the model is selected; can use all of
the train/test date to rescale the hold out data; leverage the dataset as much as possible.
