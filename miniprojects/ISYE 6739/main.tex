This work investigates the geographic and temporal transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus. A variety of statistics tools were used to draw inferences on this highly-dynamic problem. %Add Lechen's Stuff %Add Matt's Stuff 
Social distancing, quarantines, stay-at-home orders and other mandates have slowed the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. These practices come with their own costs, however, in regards to mental health, unemployment, education, etc. Because the situation is in a constant state of change, it is important to identify the most effective measures because they might need to be reenacted upon the emergence of a second wave of proliferation.
%Luke's Stuff
We preform an investigation on the doubling rate of the infection rate by country, both as a distribution and looking at individual countries.
Finally, a literature review of peer-reviewed medical journals was performed to compile a data set with published estimates of the basic reproduction number ($R_0$). From these published estimates, a meta-analysis was performed to answer the following question: is $R_0$ for COVID-19 in China decreasing with time? A simple linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the dates of the studies and their resulting estimates for $R_0$. Therefore, we conclude that more time must pass before the relationship between $R_0$ and time can be gleaned from simple linear regression.

\section{Background and Justification}

The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has already resulted in more deaths than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) combined, so understanding the transmission dynamics of this outbreak is critical to informing the public health approach \cite{1}. The current report focuses on the growth patterns associated with COVID-19, as indicated by the number of confirmed cases and number of deaths. To understand this phenomenon, we consider the effect of weather and geographic location, estimates of the virus' reproduction number obtained from medical journals, the doubling time between countries, and the impact of self-isolation measures.

The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is used by epidemiologists to quantify the intensity of an infectious disease. A disease’s $R_0$ is defined as the average number of people who will contract a disease from one contagious person. Thus, an accurate estimate of $R_0$ is instrumental to characterizing the transmission of COVID-19. An $R_0$ $>$ 0 indicates that the number of infected people is likely to increase, whereas an $R_0$ $<$ 0 indicated that the transmission of the disease is likely to die out. Therefore, the higher a disease’s $R_0$, the greater the risk to a population. A literature review of peer-reviewed medical journals was conducted to compile a data set of estimates for $R_0$ for COVID-19 in China. A total of 32 estimates for $R_0$, along with the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals and study dates, are provided in Appendix A. In the literature, a confidence level of 95\% was found to be the standard for discussions involving $R_0$. The "Study Date" column in Appendix A refers to the cutoff date for the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases that was used in each study. Some researchers used different mathematical models to develop multiple estimates of $R_0$ and each of those estimates was included as separate data points. Due to the overlap of data sets, researchers, and mathematical approaches to estimating $R_0$, this data is not independent.

\subsection{Basic Reproduction Number Analysis}
A meta-analysis was performed using published estimates for COVID-19's $R_0$. From the sample captured by the $R_0$ data set provided in Appendix A, descriptive statistics were used to quantify and visualize the central tendency and spread of these estimates. Table \ref{tab:table1} summarizes some of the relevant numeric properties of the sample. Note that a mean $R_0$ of 3.45 is interpreted as an infected person transmitting the virus to 3.45 others, on average.

\begin{table}[htp]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Descriptive Statistics for the $R_0$ Estimates.}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{l|r}
    \hline \hline
      \textbf{Measure} & \textbf{Result} \\
      \hline
      Mean & 3.45\\
      Median (Q2) & 3.01\\
      Minimum & 1.90\\
      Maximum & 6.49\\
      Range & 4.59\\
      Standard Deviation & 1.41\\
      Variance & 1.99\\
      1\textsuperscript{st} Quartile (Q1) & 2.27\\
      3\textsuperscript{rd} Quartile (Q3) & 4.43\\
      Interquartile Range (IQR) & 2.16\\
      \hline \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Using the quartile results in Table \ref{tab:table1}, a box plot of the $R_0$ estimates was plotted in figure \ref{R0DescStats} (a). To check for outliers, the lower bound and upper bound were calculated to be -0.96 and 7.66, respectively. Because all of the $R_0$ estimates used in the current analysis are contained within the range between the lower and upper bounds, none of the estimates in the data set were found to be outliers. To further visualize the spread of data, a scatter plot is provided in figure \ref{R0DescStats} (b). The magnitude of $R_0$ is plotted against the width of each estimate's 95\% confidence interval, which was calculated by taking the difference between the confidence interval's upper and lower bounds.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]

  \caption{Descriptive Statistics for $R_0$ Estimates.}
    \label{R0DescStats}
\end{figure}

Next, we aim to investigate the relationship between the magnitude of the $R_0$ estimate and the study date. The goal of this analysis is to indicate whether the transmission of the virus has grown or lessened over time. A Chinese governmental ban on public transportation that was invoked on January 23, 2020 for five major cities (Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang) \cite{2}. Thus, we choose to divide the data set into two groups: set 1 includes $R_0$ estimates from studies that used COVID-19 case data leading up to and including January 23, 2020 and set 2 data includes $R_0$ estimates from studies that considered reported cases of COVID-19 since January 23, 2020. The sample size of set 1 and set 2 are equal with 16 estimates in each category. Histograms to show the distribution of both data sets are provided in figure \ref{R0Hists}. Both distributions are positively skewed, favoring lower magnitude $R_0$ estimates.

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
  \centering
  \subfloat[$R_0$ Data Set 1 Histogram]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sm6.pdf}\label{fig:f1}}
  \hfill

  \caption{Distributions of Set 1 and Set 2 Data for $R_0$ Estimates}
    \label{R0Hists}
\end{figure}

A simple linear regression analysis is performed using the study date as the independent/predictor variable and the $R_0$ estimate as the dependent/response variable. To turn the study date into an integer, the earliest study date was given a value of zero and each day thereafter is incremented by a value of one. The resulting regression equation is \^{y} = 0.00158X + 3.4152. Because the slope of the regression line is nearly zero, we conclude that there is very little correlation between the study date and R0 estimate. The linear regression results are plotted in figure \ref{R0Reg}. A summary of the regression results is provided in table \ref{tab:table2}.

\section{Implications}
\input{luke_implications.tex}

The initial hypothesis that $R_0$ would decrease over time in response to social distancing and restrictions on public gatherings was not confirmed in the current analysis. Instead, no significant correlation between study dates and estimated $R_0$ was found. Nonetheless, we do not conclude that these variables are entirely unrelated. Instead, it is proposed that more time and more observations are necessary to observe a relationship between these variables using simple linear regression.
%Short individual implications
The implications of the two-way ANOVA analysis with countries and
government quarantine responses are that both the
factors have statistically significant effects. If the results
are taken seriously then this would imply that a custom tailored approach should be considered when decided upon the quarantine measures to enact.
%Then combination of those
\section{Future Work}
%Lechen's Stuff
The analysis on the effect of geography data indicates that it has a negative correlation with COVID-19's spread. We plan to further analyze this relationship in a fine-grained manner (e.g., analyzing the growth rate for each city in China). In addition, we will also examine other weather data to find potential factors that affect the spread of COVID-19.

%Matt's Stuff
The analysis on the effect of different quarantine measures do not take a number of details into account. The most important of which is the fact that the quarantine measures are not independent as they are overlap in regards to time. Therefore, to analyze quarantine
measures correctly there should likely be a different method developed which accounts for this. Other considerations also need to be made such as how the number of cases depends on the number of tests.

%Luke's Stuff
Given the doubling rate per country, it would be possible to attempt to correlate factors of countries, such as population density, to see what factors impact the doubling time. 
Furthermore, one could look into how the doubling time changes with respect to the measures put in place as a proxy for determining the effectiveness of the measures.

%Sara's Stuff
Given more time, extending the literature review for published estimates of $R_0$ for COVID-19 in China to produce a greater sample size would strengthen the statistical analyses performed for the current meta-analysis. If enough observations were collected in each data set such that n > 30 for estimates using reported cases prior to (data set 1) and after (data set 2) January 23, 2020, then using the assumption of approximately normally-distributed data could expand the number of inferences that could be drawn on this data.
