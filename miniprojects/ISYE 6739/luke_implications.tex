Looking at the distribution of doubling time for various countries, a number of implications arise.
First, a number of countries considered to be first world have short doubling time - notable US, the UK, Spain, Canada, France and Germany.
This could be related to the amount of testing done, as well as how quickly the country responded as a whole.
Secondly, as the doubling time does appear to follow a normal distribution, more advance analysis techniques could be used which require a normal distribution.
