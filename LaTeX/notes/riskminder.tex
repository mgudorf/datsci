Questions for Mike;
Is it odd/unrecommended/wrong to use different manipulations of the data
for predicting different quantities?

Any indication/tips on regression?

How to deal with imbalanced

do I still need to train_test split for cross validating functions?

I don't really know what to look at statistics wise because of
the deliverables I am trying to produce
