very high metric predicted from first trial is
an indication that there is contamination of the
data.
information "from the future". "self fulfilling prophecy".
Look for correlations because the accuracy is too good.

feature extraction doesn't provide understanding of the model.
Doesn't tell me why the variables matter or why.

Soemtimes it is simple to predict like image recognition
or fitbit data.
Need to really go faster. Is there an improvement?
People get fired for going slow.
Good enough is not low quality it's just improvements
that.

Best ways of checking for correllations

"Is it obvious that all of the columns belong there?"
Make sure the dependent variable isn't actually in the columns
Look at the correlation between these variables

What Different subsets?

Linearly dependent data isn't what gives us such results.
Unbalanced data.

0.2 machine learning, algorithm analyzing.
other cleaning, pipeline, exploratory data analysis.

Divide and conquer.
What are the pieces that I will have something concrete
and useful.
